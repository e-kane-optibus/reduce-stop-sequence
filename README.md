# reduce-stop-sequence

## Purpose
This script reduces each value in the stop_sequence column of stop_times.txt by 1.

## Usage
Tested with Python 3.9.
```python stop_times.py stop_times.txt``` 
Adjusted file is exported to the current directory as stop_times_syncro.txt, after which the file name can be updated and added to the feed's .zip file to replace the original stop_times.txt.
